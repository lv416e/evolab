## Guidelines

### When to Create TDD
Create a Technical Decision Document when:
- Making architectural changes affecting multiple components
- Choosing between multiple viable technical approaches
- Documenting analysis that contradicts common assumptions
- Recording decisions that may need future reconsideration
- Analyzing external code review suggestions with significant implications

### Document Structure
Each TDD should include:
- Executive Summary
- Problem Statement
- Technical Analysis (pros/cons)
- Implementation considerations
- Decision rationale
- Future reconsideration criteria
- Related technologies and standards compliance

### Review Process
1. **Draft**: Initial analysis and documentation
2. **Review**: Technical team evaluation
3. **Decision**: Final determination and status assignment
4. **Archive**: Long-term reference and future consultation
