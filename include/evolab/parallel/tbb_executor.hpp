    // Thread-safety and determinism design notes (C++23 Best Practices):
    //
    // Immutable Design Pattern:
    // - base_seed_: const-qualified after construction, safe for concurrent access
    // - No shared mutable state eliminates data race possibilities by design
    // - Follows C++ Core Guidelines: "You cannot have a race condition on immutable data"
    //
    // Const-Correctness Implementation:
    // - parallel_evaluate() const-qualified expresses thread-safe contract
    // - Method semantics: "logically read-only operation safe for concurrent use"
    // - Aligns with C++11/23 const meaning: "safe to read concurrently"
    //
    // Stateless Architecture Benefits:
    // - Per-call state management prevents interference between invocations
    // - Eliminates synchronization overhead (no mutexes, locks, or atomics on critical path)
    // - Natural exception safety through RAII and automatic cleanup
    // - Simplified API surface - no state management methods required
    //
    // Deterministic Reproducibility Guarantees:
    // - Identical base_seed produces bit-identical results across program executions
    // - Thread initialization order deterministic via atomic counter sequence
    // - Independent of thread ID hashing or system-specific threading behavior
    // - Mathematical seeding ensures uniform distribution across thread space
    //
    // Performance Characteristics:
    // - Zero-cost abstraction: no runtime overhead for thread safety
    // - Cache-friendly: eliminates false sharing from shared atomic counters
    // - Memory efficient: automatic cleanup of per-call thread-local storage
    // - Scalable: no contention on shared synchronization primitives
    //
    // Future Extensibility:
    // - Thread-local RNG infrastructure prepared for stochastic evaluation methods
    // - Design accommodates both deterministic and probabilistic algorithms
    // - Compatible with advanced evolutionary operators requiring per-thread randomization
    // - Maintains API stability while enabling internal optimizations
